    <h1>From Your UI Team</h1>
    <p class="capital">
        We always dreaded the day you would leave us, Pete. But we knew it would come eventually. We just didn't expect it to be so soon. You have been an incredible mentor, leader, and friend to all of us. We will miss your guidance, your wisdom, and your sense of humor. You have left a lasting impact on all of us, and we are grateful for everything you have done for us. 
    </p>
    <p class="no-indent">
        We wish you all the best in your future endeavors. Farewell, Pete. We will miss you.
