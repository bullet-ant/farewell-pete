    <h1>From Your UI Team</h1>
    <p class="capital">
        You have been an incredible mentor, leader, and friend to all of us. We will miss your guidance, your wisdom, and your sense of humor. You have left a lasting impact on all of us, and we are grateful for everything you have done for us. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We've so much to thank you for! Be it - decreasing the final provisioning bundle size, to moving our codebase to GitHub, to introducing us to new UI frameworks (Svelte!), to saving us from <i>Lerna Hell</i>, the list goes on and on!
    </p>
    <p>
        (God save monorepo after you're gone! ðŸ’€) 
    </p>
    <p class="no-indent">
        We wish you all the best in your future endeavors. Farewell, Pete. We will miss you.
