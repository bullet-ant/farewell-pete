    The first time I met Pete was at a conference in 2015. I was a new hire at
    the time, and I was excited to meet the team. I remember being nervous, but
    Pete was so welcoming and friendly that I felt at ease right away. He
    introduced me to everyone and made me feel like I belonged. I will always be
    grateful for his kindness and support.
